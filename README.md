# Sublime Text support for Starling

This repository contains syntax definitions and snippets for
the [Starling][] verification language.


## Licence

MIT licenceâ€”see `LICENSE`.


## Installation

For now, the easiest way to install is to clone this repository into
your local Sublime Text 3 packages directory.

This directory can be found using `Preferences > Browse Packages`
(on macOS, at least).

An actual package may be built and distributed at some point if there is
demand for it.


## Known Issues

The syntax definition file is very buggy and missing a lot of scopes.
This will likely be fixed as these bugs get shaken out during production
use.
